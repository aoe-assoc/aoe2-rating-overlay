If you wish to include a file from aoe-assoc authors in your project, make sure to
include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`COPYING.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.

Per-file license header guidelines:

In addition to this file, to prevent legal caveats, every source file *must*
include a header.

**native** source files, that is, files that were created by
_the aoe-assoc authors_, require the following one-line header, preferably in
the first line, as a comment:

    Copyright 20XX-20YY the aoe-assoc authors. See COPYING.md for legal info.

`20XX` is the year when the file was created, and `20YY` is the year when the
file was last edited. When editing a file, make sure the last-modification year
is still correct.

**3rd-party** source files, that is, files that were taken from other open-
source projects, require the following, longer header:

    This file was ((taken|adapted)|contains (data|code)) from $PROJECT,
    Copyright 1337-2013 copyright owners name.
    It's licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license.
    < any amount of lines of further legal information required by $PROJECT,
      such as a reference to a copy of the $PROJECT's README or AUTHORS file >
    < if third-party files from more than the one project were used in this
      file, copy the above any number of times >
    (Modifications|Other (data|code)|Everything else) Copyright 2020-2020 the aoe-assoc authors.
    See COPYING.md for further legal info.

In addition to the aoe-assoc header, the file's original license header should
be retained if in doubt.

The "license" line is required only if the file is not licensed as
"AGPLv3 or higher".

Authors of 3rd-party files should generally not be entered in the
"aoe-assoc authors" list.

All 3rd-party files **must** be included in the following list.
